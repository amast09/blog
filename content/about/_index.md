Hi there :wave:, my name is Aaron Mast and I am a remote software engineer.

I am a product focused, pragmatic and passionate engineer. I take pride in writing well tested, flexible, extensible, and performant software.

I love learning new things, writing tests, and building stuff.

In my spare time I enjoy distance running, watching college football and going to the beach with my dog.
